# contact management system (gui and avl-tree)
Run on ide that supports java GUI library.  
I run it on intellij idea.  
To understand this code learn about data structures and avl-trees.  
Also learn about java and it's gui library and how window works in it.  
I made only to learn about combing data structures and java language.  
It is simple project but it made my knowledge conceptually strong.  
You can update it's gui make it more visually attractive or update some logic of serching, deleting anything you want.
